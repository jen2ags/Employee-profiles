# Employee-profiles

## Purpose
The purpose of the Employee-profiles application is to generate a webpage with all of the employees and information about each. You can create a card for a Manager, Engineer, and Intern. You will be prompted to choose which one of these types of employee's profiles you want to create. Then within each type of employee, you will be prompted with different questions and information about each employee. When the html is generated, the different employeed and their information will be displayed on separate cards.
